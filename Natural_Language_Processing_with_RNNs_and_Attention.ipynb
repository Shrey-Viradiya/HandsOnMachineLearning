Instead, we will use the datasetâ€™s window() method to convert this long sequence of characters into many smaller windows of text. Every instance in the dataset will be a fairly short substring of the whole text, and the RNN will be unrolled only over the length of these substrings.

However, we cannot use a nested dataset directly for training, as our model will expect tensors as input, not datasets.
