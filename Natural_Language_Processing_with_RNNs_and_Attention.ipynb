This is useful when you want to transform each window by calling its dataset methods (e.g., to shuffle them or batch them). However, we cannot use a nested dataset directly for training, as our model will expect tensors as input, not datasets. So, we must call the flat_map() method: it converts a nested dataset into a flat dataset (one that does not contain datasets)."

When creating the Dataset, we must therefore use shift=n_steps (instead of shift=1) when calling the window() method. Moreover, we must obviously not call the shuffle() method."
